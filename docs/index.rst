Welcome to Idris JVM's documentation!
=====================================

`Idris 2`_ is a purely functional programming language with first class types. Idris JVM compiles Idris programs to JVM
bytecode enabling Idris programs to be run on the JVM. Idris JVM backend is written in Idris and
compiled with JVM backend so the compiler itself is self hosting and runs on Java 8 or above.
